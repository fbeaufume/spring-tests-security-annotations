# Security annotations in Spring tests

This repository is a sample application for my [Security annotations in Spring tests](https://www.adeliosys.fr/articles/spring-tests-security-annotations/) article.

This simple Spring Boot web application shows how to authenticate users in Spring tests using
standard Spring Security annotations and also using custom annotations.

See `FooServiceTest` for test code using both standard and custom annotations.
